# Word-Guess-Game

The most entertaining parts of this project were the imagery (with which I had a little help!) and audio.  Getting the young pirate to walk the plank, and get instructed to do so (and to move correctly "down the plank"), were interesting tasks.  As were having him "fall" into a rowboat when he wins, and fall into the water when he loses.
